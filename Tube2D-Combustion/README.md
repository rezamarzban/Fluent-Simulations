The `combustion.jou` script automates the configuration and execution of a CFD simulation using a GUI-based software, likely ANSYS Fluent. It starts by importing a geometry file named **"tube2d.unv"** and checking the grid for consistency. Physics models are enabled and configured sequentially. The energy equation is activated, and the **k-epsilon (2 eqn)** turbulence model is selected, allowing for turbulent flow modeling. Species transport is also activated, along with volumetric reactions and the eddy-dissipation model for turbulence-chemistry interaction. The mixture material is set to a specific type, selected as **option 9** from the list.

Material properties and reactions are defined next. Boundary conditions are configured for various zones. For the **velocity inlet**, a velocity magnitude of **0.05 m/s** is specified, along with a hydraulic diameter of **0.05 m** and a temperature of **500 K**. Species mass fractions are set as **0.2 for c2h6 (ethane)** and **0.8 for o2 (oxygen)**. The inlet zone is renamed to **"input"**. For the **pressure outlet**, the backflow hydraulic diameter is set to **0.05 m**, the outlet zone is renamed to **"output"**, and a mass fraction of **0.23 for o2** is defined.

The solution is initialized, using the **default initialization method** (selected as option 0). Residual monitors are configured to plot convergence data during the solution process. The number of iterations is set to **500**, and the solution is executed. After the simulation, contour plots are generated for a selected parameter (**option 3 from the drop-down menu**) with the "Filled" option enabled for better visualization.

The script concludes by writing the setup to a journal file for documentation and further use. This setup ensures the simulation covers critical aspects such as turbulence, energy transfer, chemical reactions, and accurate boundary condition definitions while automating tedious manual tasks.
