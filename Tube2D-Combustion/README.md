The `combustion.jou` script automates the configuration and execution of a CFD simulation using a GUI-based software, likely ANSYS Fluent. It starts by importing a geometry file named **"tube2d.unv"** and checking the grid for consistency. Physics models are enabled and configured sequentially. The energy equation is activated, and the **k-epsilon (2 eqn)** turbulence model is selected, allowing for turbulent flow modeling. Species transport is also activated, along with volumetric reactions and the eddy-dissipation model for turbulence-chemistry interaction. The mixture material is set to a specific type, selected as **option 9 (Ethane-Air)** from the list.

Material properties and reactions are defined next. Boundary conditions are configured for various zones. For the **velocity inlet**, a velocity magnitude of **0.05 m/s** is specified, along with a hydraulic diameter of **0.05 m** and a temperature of **500 K**. Species mass fractions are set as **0.2 for c2h6 (ethane)** and **0.8 for o2 (oxygen)**. The inlet zone is renamed to **"input"**. For the **pressure outlet**, the backflow hydraulic diameter is set to **0.05 m**, the outlet zone is renamed to **"output"**, and a mass fraction of **0.23 for o2** is defined.

The solution is initialized, using the **default initialization method** (selected as option 0). Residual monitors are configured to plot convergence data during the solution process. The number of iterations is set to **500**, and the solution is executed. After the simulation, contour plots are generated for a selected parameter (**option 3 from the drop-down menu (Temperature)**) with the "Filled" option enabled for better visualization.

The script concludes by writing the setup to a journal file for documentation and further use. This setup ensures the simulation covers critical aspects such as turbulence, energy transfer, chemical reactions, and accurate boundary condition definitions while automating tedious manual tasks.

The `tube2D.geo` script defines a rectangular geometry with specific dimensions for meshing. The characteristic length for meshing is set to **0.01 m**. Four points are defined to represent the corners of the rectangle: **(0,0)**, **(1.0,0)**, **(1.0,0.05)**, and **(0,0.05)**, forming a rectangle with a length of **1.0 m** and a diameter (or height) of **0.05 m**. 

Four lines connect these points:  
- **Line(1)** (bottom wall),  
- **Line(2)** (output boundary),  
- **Line(3)** (top wall),  
- **Line(4)** (input boundary).

These lines form a closed loop, which defines a **Plane Surface** for the geometry. Physical groups are assigned to the boundaries: **"Input"** for the left boundary, **"Walls"** for the top and bottom walls, and **"Output"** for the right boundary. The entire surface is grouped under the physical name **"Tube"**. The Delaunay algorithm is specified for meshing.

`GMSH` is a 3D finite element mesh generator used for preprocessing and geometry definition. The command **`gmsh tube2D.geo -2 -o tube2D.msh`** generates a 2D mesh from the geometry file **`tube2D.geo`** and saves it in the default **`.msh`** format. The command **`gmsh tube2D.geo -2 -format nas -o tube2D.bdf`** generates the same 2D mesh but outputs it in the **Nastran Bulk Data Format (BDF)**, commonly used for structural analysis. The command **`gmsh tube2D.geo -2 -format unv -o tube2D.unv`** creates the 2D mesh and exports it in the **Universal (UNV)** file format, suitable for various simulation tools.
