The `laminar.jou` code defines a series of Fluent commands to import a geometry file named **"tube2d.unv"**, check the grid, enable the energy equation, and configure boundary conditions. It sets the velocity magnitude to **0.05 m/s** and temperature to **270 K** for the inlet named "input," specifies a pressure outlet, and assigns a wall temperature of **330 K**. The solution is initialized with an **X velocity of 0.1 m/s**, a **Y velocity of 0.05 m/s**, and a **temperature of 280 K**. The residual plot is activated, 200 iterations are set for the solver, and the process concludes with grid display settings and journal recording being stopped.


The `tube2D.geo` script defines a rectangular geometry with specific dimensions for meshing. The characteristic length for meshing is set to **0.01 m**. Four points are defined to represent the corners of the rectangle: **(0,0)**, **(1.0,0)**, **(1.0,0.05)**, and **(0,0.05)**, forming a rectangle with a length of **1.0 m** and a diameter (or height) of **0.05 m**. 

Four lines connect these points:  
- **Line(1)** (bottom wall),  
- **Line(2)** (output boundary),  
- **Line(3)** (top wall),  
- **Line(4)** (input boundary).

These lines form a closed loop, which defines a **Plane Surface** for the geometry. Physical groups are assigned to the boundaries: **"Input"** for the left boundary, **"Walls"** for the top and bottom walls, and **"Output"** for the right boundary. The entire surface is grouped under the physical name **"Tube"**. The Delaunay algorithm is specified for meshing.

`GMSH` is a 3D finite element mesh generator used for preprocessing and geometry definition. The command **`gmsh tube2D.geo -2 -o tube2D.msh`** generates a 2D mesh from the geometry file **`tube2D.geo`** and saves it in the default **`.msh`** format. The command **`gmsh tube2D.geo -2 -format nas -o tube2D.bdf`** generates the same 2D mesh but outputs it in the **Nastran Bulk Data Format (BDF)**, commonly used for structural analysis. The command **`gmsh tube2D.geo -2 -format unv -o tube2D.unv`** creates the 2D mesh and exports it in the **Universal (UNV)** file format, suitable for various simulation tools.

Simulation in ANSYS Fluent via console:
```
file import ideas-universal C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\tube2D.unv
grid check
```

Then:
```
define models energy yes no no no yes
define boundary-conditions zone-type 5 velocity-inlet
define boundary-conditions zone-type 4 pressure-outlet
```

Then:
```
define boundary-conditions velocity-inlet 5 no no yes yes no 0.05 no 270
define boundary-conditions pressure-outlet 4 no 0 no 300 no yes no
define boundary-conditions wall 2 0 no 0 no yes temperature no 330 no no
```

Then:
```
solve initialize initialize-flow
solve iterate 200
```

Then:
```
display contour temperature
```
